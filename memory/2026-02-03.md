**Morning:** Refreshed memory, updated routing rules — sub-agents now automatically use GLM-4.7 for complex tasks. Adam confirmed this behavior is what he wants.

**Self-Improvement System Implemented:**

- System checks for:
  - New/modified files in workspace
  - New skills installed
  - Configuration changes
  - MCP tool updates
- Provides Adam with rollback/push options

**Actions:**
