## System Work

### Config Recovery
- User confirmed system working after config-breaking incident adding zai models
- Resolved successfully

### MCP Access Verification
- Verified Zapier MCP connection working
- 90 tools available via mcporter
- Config: `~/.openclaw/workspace/config/mcporter.json`

### GLM-4.7 Concurrency Stress Test

**Hypothesis:** "Can only run one GLM-4.7 at a time"

**Test 1 (15:56 PM):** Spawned 5 concurrent sub-agents
- Tasks: Count to 10, 7×8 math, haiku, capital of France, rainbow colors
- Result: ✅ All 5 completed successfully
- Total tokens: ~39,000
- Total cost: ~$0.013

**Test 2 (15:57 PM):** Spawned 20 concurrent sub-agents
- Tasks: Simple "agent X done" responses
- Result: ✅ All 20 completed successfully
- Total time: ~4 seconds
- Total tokens: ~154,000
- Total cost: ~$0.05
- Rate limit impact: Still 99% remaining

**Conclusion:** Hypothesis BUSTED. Can run 20+ concurrent GLM-4.7 agents without issues.

### z.ai Usage Review
- Screenshot showed Pro plan: 1M tokens/month, 10K requests/month, 600 prompts/5 hours
- Current usage: 0/1M tokens, 0/10K requests, 0/600 prompts
- Usage pattern: Very light, tons of headroom

### Session Status Explained
- `Runtime: direct` = Running in main OpenClaw process locally
- `Think: off/low/medium/high/stream` = Reasoning mode (internal thought visibility)
- `Elevated` = Has access to higher-impact tools

### MEMORY.md Created
- Created institutional knowledge file with:
  - System configurations
  - Personal context (Adam's profile, family, career, interests)
  - Decisions & lessons learned
  - Preferences & patterns
  - Opportunities & next steps

## User Interests

- Interested in improving Molty's capabilities
- Asked about ways to improve "power and smarts"
- Focus on workflow automation, marketing skills expansion

---

## Ideas for Future

1. Add Claude 3.5 or GPT-4o for variety
2. Set up cron jobs for daily/weekly automation ✅ COMPLETED (Feb 1, 2026)
3. Connect more tools (calendar, project management)
4. Build marketing templates for contracting business
5. Leverage marketing skills for portfolio development

---

## Automation Setup (Feb 1, 2026)

### OpenClaw Update Automation

**Created scripts:**
- `scripts/openclaw-update.sh` - Runs at 5am EST, checks and installs updates
- `scripts/openclaw-update-recap.sh` - Runs at 7am EST, sends recap if updates occurred

**Cron jobs configured:**
1. "OpenClaw Daily Update Check" - 5:00 AM EST daily
2. "OpenClaw Update Recap" - 7:00 AM EST daily

**Workflow:**
- Updates run non-interactively with `--yes --json`
- Status tracked in `.update-status.json`
- If updates happen, recap sent at 7am with version info
- Logs stored in `logs/update-YYYYMMDD.log` and `logs/recap-YYYYMMDD.log`

**Status:** Scripts created, cron jobs scheduled, but update command hangs when testing (PATH issue in non-interactive shells).

## Z.ai Models & Research (Feb 1, 2026)

### Brave Search API Setup

**Added to config:**
- Provider: Brave
- API Key: `BSAi12iJsHC8XXqgMwEA0N6tMWN76cw`
- Max results: 5
- Timeout: 30 seconds

**Gateway restarted:** Config applied successfully

**Test:** web_search working - can now search for research, news, competitors.

### Z.ai Models Research

**Discovered models available on Pro plan:**

**Text models (all 128K context):**
- **glm-4.7** - $0.60 input / $2.20 output (latest, best for reasoning/coding)
- **glm-4.7-flash** - $0.07 input / $0.40 output (90% cheaper! fast)
- **glm-4.5** - $0.60 input / $2.20 output (stable, good writing)
- **glm-4.5-air** - $0.20 input / $0.90 output (ultra-fast)
- **glm-4.6v** - $0.60 input / $2.20 output (stable alternative)
- **glm-4.32b** - FREE (legacy, limited)

**Vision models:**
- **glm-4.6v** - $0.30/M for images

**Key finding:** glm-4.7-flash is 90% cheaper than glm-4.7 - perfect for quick tasks!

### Model Routing Configuration

**Created files:**
- `config/zai-models.md` - Full pricing and model list
- `config/model-routing.md` - Routing rules using ONLY z.ai models

**Routing strategy (z.ai only):**
- Quick/Q&A → glm-4.7-flash (fastest, cheapest)
- Copywriting/proposals → glm-4.7 (strong writing)
- Strategy/analysis → glm-4.7 (deep reasoning)
- Coding/debugging → glm-4.7 (best programming)
- Social media → glm-4.5 (variety)
- Vision/screenshots → glm-4.6v

**Cost optimization potential:**
- Use glm-4.7-flash for routine tasks: 90% savings
- Leverage cache for repeated context: 10x savings on input

**Decision:** NO external providers needed (Claude/GPT) - Z.ai Pro covers all use cases efficiently.

## Issues & Incidents

### Cron Job Update Crash (Feb 1, 2026, ~7:30 PM EST)

**Issue:** When attempting to update cron jobs for daily updates, the system completely froze:
- No response at all from agent
- User couldn't even open a TUI in a fresh terminal
- Required full OpenClaw reinstall to recover

**Recovery:**
- User reinstalled OpenClaw
- Cron jobs survived the reinstall (stored separately from main config)
- System operational after reinstall

**Key Takeaway:** Cron job modifications can be risky. Future approach:
- Test cron changes carefully
- Consider backing up cron/jobs.json before modifications
- If issue persists, report to OpenClaw team
- The warning message format from the user (`[2026-02-01 19:35:25 EST] Exec completed`) shows command eventually ran after ~42 seconds, suggesting a timeout/deadlock scenario

---

## File Cleanup

**Feb 1, 2026:** Removed all .bak files from OpenClaw directory
- First pass: Found `openclaw.json.bak` and `cron/jobs.json.bak` - deleted
- User still seeing files: Discovered numbered versions (`.bak.1`, `.bak.2`, etc.)
- Second pass: `find /home/mccargo/.openclaw -name "*.bak.*" -type f -delete`
- Result: All backup files removed successfully

---

## Notes

- **Workspace:** `/home/mccargo/.openclaw/workspace`
- **OpenClaw Version:** 2026.1.30
- **Node:** mccargo-pi5 (Raspberry Pi 5)
- **OS:** Linux 6.8.0-1045-raspi (arm64)
- **Gateway:** Running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`


### Model Aliases Added (Feb 1, 2026)

**Config updated:** Added aliases to openclaw.json

**New aliases configured:**
- `glm` → glm-4.7 (primary)
- `glm-flash` → glm-4.7-flash (90% cheaper, fast)
- `glm-4.5` → glm-4.5 (stable, good for writing)
- `glm-air` → glm-4.5-air (ultra-fast, low-latency)
- `glm-vision` → glm-4.6v (vision capabilities)

**Usage:** Easy model switching by alias:
- Use `glm-flash` for quick questions (90% cost savings!)
- Use `glm-4.7` or `glm` for client work
- Use `glm-4.5` for writing tasks
- Use `glm-vision` when analyzing screenshots/images

**All models:** 128K context window
**No external providers needed:** Z.ai Pro plan covers all use cases.
