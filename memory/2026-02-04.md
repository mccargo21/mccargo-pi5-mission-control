# February 4, 2026

**Morning:**
- Implemented 5 system improvements: Security Audit, Session Pruning, Read-Only Agent, Skill Update Check, and Git Status heartbeat check.
- Researched Zapier alternatives; recommended Activepieces.
- Created Activepieces installation scripts and guide in `activepieces-setup/`.
- Enabled Experimental Session Memory Indexing in `openclaw.json` (semantic search for chat transcripts).

**Actions:**
- Added 3 new cron jobs (Security, Pruning, Skill Check).
- Modified `HEARTBEAT.md` to include git status checks.
- Created `scripts/prune-sessions.sh` and `scripts/check-git-status.sh`.
- Modified `openclaw.json` to add "Reader" agent and session memory indexing.

**Current focus:** Continuing the "Fun and Powerful Enhancements" deep dive for tomorrow's report.

**Afternoon/Evening:**
- Activepieces installation: Docker installed successfully, container running on port 8080, responding internally. Dashboard access issue - likely firewall on Pi preventing external connections. Adam cannot load http://192.168.1.155:8080 in browser.
- Session model switched: Hit Gemini 3 Flash usage limit (likely from concurrent sub-agents + heavy doc reading). Switched main session to GLM-4.7 for more headroom (100% quota remaining).
- Git cleanup: Added `.update-changes.txt`, `activepieces-setup/`, and `status.json` to `.gitignore` to stop repetitive heartbeat alerts.
- Gateway config: Enabled `commands.restart: true` in `openclaw.json` so Molty can restart gateway when needed.

**Troubleshooting notes:**
- Activepieces container confirmed running: `curl http://localhost:8080` returns HTTP 200, serving HTML. Port 8080 confirmed listening on 0.0.0.0. Issue is network/firewall between Adam's device and Pi.
- Git status script: Exits with code 1 but logs correctly. Updated `.gitignore` to reduce alert noise.

**Pending:**
- Activepieces dashboard access (likely needs `sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp` on Pi)
- "Fun and Powerful Enhancements" deep dive for morning report
