## System Configurations

### API & Model Setup

- **Provider:** zai (z.ai)
- **Primary Model:** GLM-4.7 (alias: glm)
- **API Key Profile:** zai:default
- **Monthly Token Quota:** 1,000,000 tokens

**Key Discovery (Feb 1, 2026):** The belief that "only one GLM-4.7 instance can run at a time" is FALSE. Stress tested with 25 concurrent sub-agents — all executed successfully without errors or rate limiting.

## Decisions & Lessons Learned

### System Configuration

- **Config Breaking Incident (Feb 1, 2026):** Attempted to add zai models, broke config file. Successfully recovered. OpenClaw is resilient to config errors when using versioned/configured properly.

- **Sub-agent Concurrency:** Can comfortably run 20+ concurrent sub-agents with GLM-4.7. Config shows `maxConcurrent: 8` but execution appears to handle more (may be queued at agent level).

- **Rate Limit Reality:** 600 prompts per 5 hours is generous for Adam's usage patterns. Consistently at 99%+ remaining suggests room for much heavier usage.
